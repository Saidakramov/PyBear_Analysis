# PyBear_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
- During this analysis, our objectives were to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, create a multiple-line graph showing each city type's total weekly fares. Finally, submit a written report summarizing how the data differs by city type and how decision-makers can use those differences at PyBer.

## Results:

- PyBer summary:

- As we can see from the information above, it is clear that Urban cities bring most of the revenue, while suburban and rural cities share 2nd and 3rd places respectively. We can also notice that the average fare per ride and driver is higher in rural and suburban areas than in urban areas. It could be related to the number of drivers and rides, where number of rides is more than the number of drivers. Therefore, urban cities have 780 more drivers than rides resulting in considerably low fares per driver, while other drivers from suburban and rural cities are earning 2x and 3x times more. 

- Multple-line chart:

- The first thing we can notice is that all three types of cities are peaking at the end of February, right before the decrease at the beginning of March. 
Urban cities start January with little over $1600 and maintain fares of just over $2000 until the end of April. Cities peak at the end of February and the first quarter of March, reaching about $2500. 

- Suburban cities start with about $700 and increase until they peak at about $1400 at the end of February. They dropped to approximately $800 and stayed at that level until they started increasing at the beginning of April and reached about $1300 by the end of April. 

- Rural cities had a start with about $200 in January. They had their ups and down until they reached their highest point in April with about $500 and started slightly declining towards the end of April. 


## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- 1) My first recommendation would be to either increase number of rides or decrease the number of drivers in Urban cities. Urban cities are bringing most of the revenue; therefore, raising the interest to get more riders could be beneficial, which could benefit both drivers and the company. The current situation proves that drivers from rural cities earn more than drivers from urban cities, which could be highly discouraging for city drivers, resulting in the loss of drivers and increasing the spending budget for the company to bring in new drivers.

- 2)Secondly, it would be beneficial to decrease the fare price in suburban areas, which could be affordable for more riders and result in more rides and more drivers' earnings.

- 3) The same could be applied to rural cities. With decreased prices, interest in ride-sharing could bring many more customers.

All these recommendations could satisfy all parties, where riders are paying less, drivers are earning more, and PyBer has more revenue.
