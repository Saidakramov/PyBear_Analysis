# PyBear_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
- During this analysis our objectives were to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, to submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
